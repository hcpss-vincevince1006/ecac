<p class="post__paragraph--callout" style="font-weight:bold;">Your baby’s brain grows with every interaction you have together.</p>
<p class="post__paragraph--callout">From the earliest moments when you repeat your baby’s sounds back to her or tell him how much he is loved, your baby is making important connections. Children who have parents talking with them are put on a <strong>path towards better development</strong>.</p>
<p>We know that babies communicate for a reason. We know that responding to your baby’s cries, needs, and preferences in a <strong>positive</strong> way teaches your baby to communicate. We also know that having a rich interactive relationship with your child lays a foundation for good mental health. Whether you speak in English, or in your heritage language, or in a combination of languages, all languages help your child to develop. </p>
<p>As you change your tone of voice and adjust your touch to soothe, stimulate, and hold your baby’s attention, you begin a <strong>conversation</strong> that prepares your baby for lifelong learning.</p>

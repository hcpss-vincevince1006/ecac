<div class="two-thirds--last" style="border-left: 1px solid #E7E7E7; padding-left: 1em;">
<ul>
<li>Use real language and rich vocabulary (i.e. Your shirt is fuschia. That car is maroon.)</li>
<li>Talk about your experiences (i.e. We need to wait for the red light to cross the street. Look at the shaggy dog!)</li>
<li>Ask open-ended questions (i.e. What do you think is making that sound? Where do you think that bunny lives?)</li>
<li>Use math vocabulary when talking to your child (i.e. How many bananas do you see? Which eggplant feels heavier?)</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="two-thirds--last" style="border-left: 1px solid #E7E7E7; padding-left: 1em;">
<p>Every time a parent or caregiver has a positive, engaging verbal interaction with a child—whether it is talking, singing, or reading—neural connections of all kinds are strengthened within the child’s rapidly growing brain.</p>

<li>Let children pick up sticks and natural materials outside and use them for art projects or other fun activities</li>
<li>Have fun, play with your children</li>

<li>Sing songs at bath time and when taking walks.</li>

<li>Create music and a marching band with pots and pans and spoons!</li>

<p>A child’s early years set the trajectory for the relationships and successes they will experience for the rest of their lives, making it crucial that all children are afforded the high-quality early learning experiences they need to thrive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go on a walk outside and look for bugs, flowers, colors and shapes. Talk about them with your child; let them touch items that are safe to explore more closely.</li>
<li>Use play dough, paint, shaving cream, dirt or sand to explore different materials and textures. Draw pictures, letters numbers and shapes using your fingers.</li>
<li>Give your child crayons and paper to draw with and measuring spoons and cups to play with water.</li>
<li>Visit your local library for books and child classes.</li>
